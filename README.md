ðŸ“¡ Multi-Session Breakout Alert Bot â€“ Python

This bot monitors almost 500 Binance Futures coins across Asian, London, and New York trading sessions. It tracks session highs and lows and sends real-time alerts to Telegram whenever a price breaks one of these key levels.

Key Features

Monitors multiple trading sessions (Asia â†’ London â†’ New York) automatically

Sends instant Telegram notifications when a breakout happens

Avoids duplicate alerts â€“ if a level was already broken before the bot starts, it will send the alert once but wonâ€™t repeat it

Helps traders spot potential opportunities without constantly watching the screen

Built in Python using Pandas for data handling and Requests for API calls

How It Works

Collects 15-minute candle data for each coin

Calculates session highs and lows

Sends alerts only when a new breakout occurs, so you wonâ€™t get spammed

Why Itâ€™s Useful

Makes it easier to stay disciplined and follow a data-driven trading approach

Lets you monitor hundreds of coins at the same time

Can be extended to additional strategies like liquidity sweeps or moving averages
